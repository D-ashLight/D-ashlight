### 🤖 Prompting Ideas into Reality
I don't just write code; I orchestrate AI to build meaningful experiences. As a **Vibe Coder**, I leverage the power of LLMs and AI design tools to bridge the gap between human empathy and digital interaction.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- **Vibe Coding:** Building products using Google AI Studio, Cursor, Claude, and Codex.
- **AI-Driven Design:** Rapid prototyping with Figma AI and Stitch.
- **HCI Research:** Obsessed with how AI can make human-computer interaction feel more natural and caring.

## 🌟 Featured Project: [CareBridge](https://github.com/D-ashLight/CareBridge)
**Built for the Google Gemini API Hackathon**
- **The Vibe:** An empathetic healthcare companion that actually listens—building a bridge to resolve doctor-patient communication gaps.
- **The Journey:** My first hackathon as a **Solo Player**! Accomplished the transition from 0 to a complete product within 20 days.
- **Tools Used:** Google AI Studio, React.
- **Watch the demo video:** [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXalNKRFYro)
